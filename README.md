# Snake-Game-Using-Copilot
This project was developed entirely with GitHub Copilot. Initially, Copilot generated a basic Snake game; however, I encountered several issues that needed to be addressed through iterations with the AI.

üêç Development Process
At first, the game had a bug where the snake could not change direction after the initial move. I prompted Copilot to fix this issue, and after a few attempts, the problem wasn't resolved. 

Eventually, I noticed that the snake moved too fast and immediately collided with the wall. I had not realized this earlier because, upon hitting the wall, the game did not reset as expected. To address this, I asked Copilot to reduce the snake‚Äôs speed and implement an automatic reset when the player lost.

Another issue was that, occasionally, the snake would skip the food without consuming it, making it feel like a portal. I instructed Copilot to fix this, ensuring that the snake‚Äôs head coordinates precisely matched the food‚Äôs coordinates.

For additional features, I requested Copilot to display the score and progressively increase the snake's speed each time it consumed food, enhancing the gameplay experience.

ü§ñ Key Takeaway
This project demonstrated that, while AI can assist in development, it does not always produce perfect solutions on its own. Critical thinking and problem analysis remain essential to identifying issues and guiding the AI toward effective fixes. The combination of AI-assisted coding and human problem-solving results in a more efficient and refined development process.
